The sky had turned a dark shade of grey, casting an almost surreal light over the city.
As I stepped out, raindrops fell in gentle sheets, painting the pavement with ripples.
The world felt muted, as if the rain was slowing everything down.
With each step, I could hear the soft tap of my shoes on the wet ground, blending with the rhythm of the storm.
